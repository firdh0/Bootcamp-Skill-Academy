Set up Elasticsearch Index\n","\n","The first step you need to do which is **preprocessing, let's keep it simple and simply drop all row that have missing values.**\n","\n","Next, you need to set up an Elasticsearch index. An Elasticsearch index is like a database in a traditional relational database. An index lets you store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time.\n","\n","You'll also need to setup the mappings for the data types, let's do that here."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"id":"n0VCxNld7WEQ","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708528584182,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Firdho","userId":"06939471467567771892"},"user_tz":-420},"id":"n0VCxNld7WEQ","outputId":"0c1da698-05c9-455f-fe8e-f3fd8a0fcb44"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"dataframe","variable_name":"df_data"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-b9c4d338-538e-4130-a1e4-4aad029ac01d\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>InvoiceNo</th>\n","      <th>StockCode</th>\n","      <th>Description</th>\n","      <th>Quantity</th>\n","      <th>InvoiceDate</th>\n","      <th>UnitPrice</th>\n","      <th>CustomerID</th>\n","      <th>Country</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>536365</td>\n","      <td>85123A</td>\n","      <td>WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>12/1/2010 8:26</td>\n","      <td>2.55</td>\n","      <td>17850.0</td>\n","      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>536365</td>\n","      <td>71053</td>\n","      <td>WHITE METAL LANTERN</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>12/1/2010 8:26</td>\n","      <td>3.39</td>\n","      <td>17850.0</td>\n","      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>536365</td>\n","      <td>84406B</td>\n","      <td>CREAM CUPID HEARTS COAT HANGER</td>\n","      <td>8</td>\n","      <td>12/1/2010 8:26</td>\n","      <td>2.75</td>\n","      <td>17850.0</td>\n","      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>536365</td>\n","      <td>84029G</td>\n","      <td>KNITTED UNION FLAG HOT WATER BOTTLE</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>12/1/2010 8:26</td>\n","      <td>3.39</td>\n","      <td>17850.0</td>\n","      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>536365</td>\n","      <td>84029E</td>\n","      <td>RED WOOLLY HOTTIE WHITE HEART.</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>12/1/2010 8:26</td>\n","      <td>3.39</td>\n","      <td>17850.0</td>\n","      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-b9c4d338-538e-4130-a1e4-4aad029ac01d')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-b9c4d338-538e-4130-a1e4-4aad029ac01d button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
