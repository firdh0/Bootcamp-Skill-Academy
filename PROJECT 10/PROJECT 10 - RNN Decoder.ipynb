In this phase, the hidden states generated by the Encoder serve as inputs for the Decoder. The following steps provide guidance on how to manipulate these hidden states in the Decoder to generate our desired output sequence.\n","\n","1. **Copy the Last Hidden State from the Encoder**:\n","    - Start by identifying the last hidden state from the encoder.
